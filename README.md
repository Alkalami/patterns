This is the pattern library for the City of Boston. It's currently a work in progress, but we're adding to it every day.

## Installing

We recommend using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Running

Once the repository has been cloned, you can build the components with:

`yarn gulp build`

After building the components, you can run `yarn fractal -- start --watch` to get a server running. You should be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and view the pattern library.

## Development

The pattern library is built using Stylus. We're using PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and Rucksack as well. When Javascript is required, we're using plain javascript. All components should work without javascript as a default.

To develop against the pattern library, you can run:

`yarn gulp`

This will build the components and watch for changes. Run `yarn fractal -- start --watch` in another window to keep a server running.

## Check-in / Deployment

PRs should be made against the develop branch. To do a deploy, force-push the
develop branch on to the production branch. Force-push prevents production from
accidentally getting changes that arenâ€™t in develop.
