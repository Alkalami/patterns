# cob-viz

This element bridges the JSON configuration generated by
[vizwiz](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/vizwiz) into web components. It accepts
the configuration block as an attribute or embedded `<script>` and generates the
appropriate `<cob-map>` and `<cob-esri-layer>` components.

## Slots

#### config

Alternate way to define the JSON configuration from the `config` attribute that
avoids the need to HTML escape and put in the “config” attribute. Include a
`<script slot="config" type="application/json">` element whose text contents are
the JSON configuration. 

<!-- Auto Generated Below -->


## Properties

#### config

string

A JSON string or equivalent object that defines the map and layers. The
schema for this config comes from VizWiz, so it won’t be documented here.

Any attributes prefixed with `map-` will be passed on to the generated
`<cob-map>` component. _E.g._ `map-id` or `map-style`.
